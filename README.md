## Model of a simple stock market

[![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1-yellow.svg)](https://semver.org)

This is a reproduction of a 1994 paper [Artificial economic life](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/31402) by Palmer, et al. It tries to implement ideas described in the paper, but is quite quick thanks to being implemented on a GPU.
